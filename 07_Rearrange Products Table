# Write your MySQL query statement below

select product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 as price
from Products 
where store1 is not null
Union all
select product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as price
from Products 
where store2 is not null
Union all

select product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as price
from Products
where store3 is not null 

###### Alternate solution
UNPIVOT Function can help us to improve the performance of the query.However MySQL doesnt have Unpivot function

SELECT product_id , store , price
FROM Products
UNPIVOT
(
price
FOR store in (store1, store2, store3)
) AS Products_Unpivoted
