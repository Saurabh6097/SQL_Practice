with large  as (select department_id, 
       count(distinct id) as dept_count 
from az_employees 
group by department_id
order by dept_count desc
limit 1) 

select first_name,
       last_name,
       position
    from az_employees
    where department_id in (select distinct department_id from large)
    and position like '%manager%'

###Alternate solution
with cte as(select * from (select department_id,count(distinct id) as num_employees,rank()over(order by count(distinct id) desc ) as rnk1
from az_employees
group by department_id) tbl
where rnk1=1)
 select a.*
 from cte c
 inner join az_employees a
 on a.department_id=c.department_id
where a.position ='Manager'
